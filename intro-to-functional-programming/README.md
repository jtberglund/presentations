# Introduction to Functional Programming

Tech talk given 11/3/2017

### Overview

Functional programming is a programming paradigm centered around concepts such as function composition, immutability of data, and declarative programming. Over the past few years it has risen in popularity, partly thanks to the growth of Javascript, and many of today's most popular frameworks and libraries are built on functional programming ideas. This talk will cover the basics of functional programming, the false dichotomy of functional programming vs. object-oriented programming, and practical ways to write more concise and maintainable code.
